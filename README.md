# CS50-PSET1-Credit

My solution for the 1st Problem Set of CS50: Introduction to Computer Science (https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).

a basic C program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, or if it's invalid, using Luhnâ€™s Algorithm.

$ ./credit
Number: 6176292929
INVALID
